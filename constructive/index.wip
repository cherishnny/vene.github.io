            <h2>Effective teamwork hinges on good social interaction.</h2>
            <p>
                Working in groups is a common strategy for tackling challenging tasks; research confirmed that <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3049524/know-it-all/the-science-behind-team-intelligence">team intelligence</a> is a real thing.  Still, everybody who's ever been in a few such problem-solving teams knows that it doesn't always work out smoothly.  Surveys confirm that people often perceive many meetings as unproductive, from
                <a href="http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2001/0981/01/09811072.pdf">one third</a> to as many as
                <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/16/technology/survey/">69%</a>!
                But are there recognizable characterizes of how constructive teams interact? And how can we tease apart constructiveness, which can maybe be improved, from just having more skilled individuals?
            </p>
            <p>
                In our work, we propose a way to measure constructiveness based on the improvement in a team's answer when compared to the team members' earlier answers, before discussion.
                Think of school projects.  Sure, a team of usual <em>A</em> students can get a good grade on a group assignment, maybe even without talking at all.  What's more interesting is if a group of <em>D</em> students manage to get an <em>A</em> as a group.  Even more, we want to know that they would still get <em>Ds</em> if given an individual quiz before interacting with the group. If this is the case, it must mean that the improvement really came from good group dynamics.</p>
            <p>
                We develop an fun online game where we can observe which teams interact more constructively, and identify conversational, linguistic, and interaction signals of constructive and non-constructive team discussion.

            <p>
                During their collaborative decision process,
				constructive teams make guesses that get closer
				and closer to the correct answer; in contrast,
				nonconstructive teams make guesses that take
				them farther from the correct answer.

				Stopping non-constructive teams early can therefore not only save time, but also lead to better answers than if they would carry on.

            <h3>What's the big idea?</h3>
            <p>
            	We employ a novel way of analyzing conversations, by identifying who introduces new ideas and who adopts them, by the order in which they are mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                In teams that, together, outperform even their best member,  fewer ideas are adopted overall.  The language used when introducing and adopting ideas is important as well: the trend is even more pronounced when looking at ideas introduced using hedging words such as <em>maybe</em>, <em>perhaps</em>, or <em>I think</em>.

            <h3>Balanced, equal-footed interaction.</h3>
            <p>
            	In teams that outperform the best player, users take turns controlling the marker more uniformly, and repeat fewer syntactic structures when responding to each other.  Syntactic language matching has been shown to correlate with power imbalance, therefore, this suggests that the most constructive teams are more balanced, both in terms of answer input and in terms of power relations.

                <p>
                    Group discussions are essential for organizing every aspect of modern life, from faculty meetings to senate debates, from grant review panels to papal conclaves.  While costly in terms of time and organization effort, group discussions are commonly seen as a way of reaching better decisions compared to solutions that do not require coordination between the individuals (e.g. voting)---through discussion, the sum becomes greater than the parts.  However, this assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions abounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are unproductive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We propose a framework for analyzing conversational dynamics in order to determine whether a given task-oriented discussion is worth having or not.  We exploit conversational patterns reflecting the flow of ideas and the balance between the participants, as well as their linguistic choices.  We apply this framework to conversations naturally occurring in an online collaborative world exploration game developed and deployed to support this research.  Using this setting, we show that linguistic cues and conversational patterns extracted from the first 20 seconds of a team discussion are predictive of whether it will be a wasteful or a productive one.
