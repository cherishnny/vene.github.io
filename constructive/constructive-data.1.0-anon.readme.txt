Cornell Constructive Conversations Corpus
=========================================

Description:
	This dataset contains 1450 team discussions, collected from the
	StreetCrowd geographical puzzle game [1].  Each team, consisting of 2 to 4
    players, provides individual guesses, and then, following a discussion, a
    single final guess.

	This release is *anonymized* by replacing player nicknames with unique
    identifiers, and removing infrequent words.  We provide extracted features
    that take into account the hidden words.

	See below for a reference of the files and fields therein.

    pron_you                 number of second person pronouns in message


    (reason-level)
    (same features, except the n_adopted* ones: reasons are written before
     any interaction with other players, so adopting ideas is not possible.)

    (turn-level)

    disagree                 does this turn manifest disagreement?
